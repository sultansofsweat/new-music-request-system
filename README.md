# The Music Request System software

The Music Request System was officially conceived in 2015, and released to the public in 2017. It has been published to Github as the project has grown well beyond the need to have proper version control.

This repository is for "newer" releases, starting with 2.5, in order to enact some changes I would like to do with respect to organizing how branches work and other related activities.
The original repository is here: https://github.com/sultansofsweat/music-request-system
